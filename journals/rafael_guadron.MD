First day of project work for module 3. The idea we came up with for our project is an application that suggests coffee drinks to users based on forms with prompted question which the user would fill out.

August 8, 2023
Today we came up with and agreed on a new project idea. We agreed that we would work on a personal expenses tracking application.

August 9, 2023
Today we worked on our basic framework/ wireframe for our project. We also completed our MVP to show to the class.

August 10, 2023
We are now working on our API endpoint designs and how they'll all connect on the backend. 

August 11, 2023
We have worked on our table designs for the webpages and our MVP has passed the instructor review.

August 14, 2023
The complete design to our project is ready to review (the API design and tables). We plan on spending time getting everyone up to speed and on the same page. Jonathan has begun with the docker-compose file.

August 15, 2023
We decided to work with pgAdmin after figuring out how the relationship would work whith FASTAPI and the database. The first merge request was made by Jonathan and approved by Tawain.

August 16, 2023
We worked on our first table together as a group. Tawain worked on the expenses table and I worked on the category table and chose to work on the expenses endpoints.

August 17, 2023
Today I started work on the expenses.py routers and queries. Since the expenses table was created already, now I just have to test my code and make sure that it relates correctly to the table.

August 18, 2023
We all joined a zoom call Phil hosted even though we did not have class so that we could continue working on the project. I just continued making progress with the expenses endpoints.

August 21, 2023
No issues so far, just continuing working on the expenses.py endpoints. The routers should be completed by tomorrow.

August 22, 2023
We completed some merge requests in order to receive already completed code and Jonathan also worked on the authorization code with some help from the instructors. I completed my endpoints today.

August 23, 2023
Today we spent a lot of time figuring out merge issues from merge requests and continued working on our endpoints now that we had to add authorization to protect them.

August 24, 2023
Today I wanted to add the authorization code on my expenses endpoints but many issues were coming up with trying to protect the delete expenses endpoint on FAST API. Spent all of today trying to get this working.

August 25, 2023
Today I finally reworked most of the code on the queries/routers for expenses to make the protected endpoints work. I created a merge request and Phil approved it.

August 28, 2023
Today we dealt with everyones merges and had some issues dealing with merge conflicts so we spent most of the day dealing with that. 

September 4, 2023
This week we worked on our individual front end components of the website. I worked on the doughnut chart and made sure that it was fully functional with all the data being auto populated on the graphs from the form. This week we also completed most of our front-end work and deployed the webpage. We also made sure that the unit tests passed while on the deployed websites. 

September 11, 2023
Today we debugged our webpage since we had an issue with being able to see the webpage at the correct deployed url. We also made sure to catch up on all of our individual components and are ready to present our basically finished module 3 project.
