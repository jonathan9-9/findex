## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Today, I worked on making my first issue/feature on Gitlab of completing the docker compose yml file and I demoed the workflow for creating an issue and creating a feature branch to create my first merge request. The merge request was reviewed and approved by
Tawain after pulling it and testing my branch. Everything successfully worked and was approved by him and I proceeded with finalizing the merge request. Then my teammates pulled those changes from the main branch. The testing involved accessing certain
local host ports to ensure that they are working properly after configuring the docker file.

Today, I worked on completing the database schema with Phil and Tawain. Then the same day I installed a Visual Studio Code
extension called Code Spell Checker and black to format python code. I then got the docker containers up and running. To test
that the development server and localhost ports are working I tested them out on the web browser and opened up the FastAPI docs
to test out the users endpoints including the GET, POST and DELETE.
