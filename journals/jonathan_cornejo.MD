## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Today, I worked on completing the database schema with Phil and Tawain. Then the same day I installed a Visual Studio Code
extension called Code Spell Checker and black to format python code. I then got the docker containers up and running. To test
that the development server and localhost ports are working I tested them out on the web browser and opened up the FastAPI docs
to test out the users endpoints including the GET, POST and DELETE.
